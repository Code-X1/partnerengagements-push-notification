I got bored visiting https://boards.greenhouse.io/partnerengagementstaffing to check for new partner engagements, because let's face it, most time you won't find anything new. I also didn't want to miss out when there's an opening that matches my skill/Eng level, so I built a web app to notify me when new engagements are opened. I hope you find it helpful too :)

## How it works
- Polls [greenhouse](https://boards.greenhouse.io/partnerengagementstaffing) every 30mins for new partner engagements
- Sends push notificaitons to registered clients (browsers) **ONLY** when there are new engagement openings


## Push me some engagements
- Visit https://pe-push.codeshifu.dev
- Allow notification permissions
- Close the page and pretend it never existed

That's it! Just like that, new engagement openings will be delivered to your ~~door step~~ browser
